  @selenium
  Scenario: Teacher prints the listing of all investigations
    When I am on the investigations page
    Then I should see "Newest"
    And I should see "Medium"
    And I should see "Oldest"
    And I should see "printable view"
    And "printable-view" should have href like "printable_index"
    And the link to "printable-view" should have a target "_blank"
    When I am on the investigations printable index page
    Then I should see "Investigation"
    And I should see "Usage Count"
    And I should see "Newest"
    And I should see "Medium"
    And I should see "Oldest"
    
  @selenium
  Scenario: Teacher prints the listing of a subset of investigations
    When I am on the investigations like "New" page
    Then I should see "Newest"
    And I should not see "Medium"
    And I should not see "Oldest"
    And I should see "printable view"
    And "printable-view" should have href like "printable_index" with params "name=New"
    And the link to "printable-view" should have a target "_blank"
    When I am on the investigations printable index page
    Then I should see "Investigations"
    And I should see "Usage Count"
    And I should see "Newest"
    And I should not see "Medium"
    And I should not see "Oldest"
