Feature: An author adds multiple choice_questions
  As a Investigations author
  I want to add a multiple choice questions to my investigations
  So that I can understand what my students are learning.
  
  Background:
    Given The default project and jnlp resources exist using mocks

  @selenium
  Scenario: The author adds a multiple choice question to an investigation
    Given the following users exist:
      | login        | password            | roles                |
      | author       | author              | member, author       |
    Given the following investigation exists:
      | name                 | description           | user                 |
      | testing fast cars    | how fast can cars go? | author               |
    
    And I login with username: author password: author
    When I show the first page of the "testing fast cars" investigation
    Then I should see "Page: 1"
    When I follow "Multiple Choice Question"
    Then I should see "Why do you think ..."
    When I follow xpath "//a[@title='edit multiple choice question']"
    Then I should see "choices"
    And I should see "a"
    And I should see "b"
    And I should see "c"
