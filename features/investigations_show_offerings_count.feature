Feature: Investigations show the offerings count
  So I can see how many times an investigation has been assigned
  As a teacher
  I want to see the offerings count
  
  Background:
    Given The default project and jnlp resources exist using factories
    Given the following teachers exist:
      | login         | password        |
      | teacher       | teacher         |
    And the following classes exist:
      | name      | teacher     |

    Scenario: The investigations list can show the offerings count
      Given the following investigations exist:
        | name    | user      | offerings_count | created_at                      | publication_status  |
        | Newest  | teacher   | 5               | Wed Jan 26 12:00:00 -0500 2011  | published           |
        | Medium  | teacher   | 10              | Wed Jan 23 12:00:00 -0500 2011  | published           |
        | Oldest  | teacher   | 20              | Wed Jan 20 12:00:00 -0500 2011  | published           |
      When I show offerings count on the investigations page
      Then I should see "assigned 5 times"
      And I should see "assigned 10 times"
      And I should see "assigned 20 times"
