  @selenium
  Scenario: Teacher prints the listing of all resource pages
    When I am on the resource pages page
    Then I should see "Newest"
    And I should see "Medium"
    And I should see "Oldest"
    And I should see "printable view"
    And "printable-view" should have href like "printable_index"
    And the link to "printable-view" should have a target "_blank"
    When I am on the resource pages printable index page
    Then I should see "Resources"
    And I should see "Usage Count"
    And I should see "Newest"
    And I should see "Medium"
    And I should see "Oldest"
    
  @selenium
  Scenario: Teacher prints the listing of a subset of resource page
    When I am on the resource pages like "New" page
    Then I should see "Newest"
    And I should not see "Medium"
    And I should not see "Oldest"
    And I should see "printable view"
    And "printable-view" should have href like "printable_index" with params "name=New"
    And the link to "printable-view" should have a target "_blank"
    When I am on the resource pages printable index page
    Then I should see "Resources"
