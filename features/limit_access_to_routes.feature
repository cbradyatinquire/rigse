Feature: Limit access to restricted routes

Only logged in users with appropriate roles should be able to see and change resources in the portal.

If a user without the appropriate role or permissions attempts to access a resource the system should redirect the user with an appropriate warning message.

In NO case should the system allow:
* access to private student data to unauthorized users
* unauthorized users to edit or delete resources they shouldn't

  As a person concerned about security
  I want ensure that I can not access restricted routes
  So that we can protect our users data

  Background:
    Given The default project and jnlp resources exist using mocks
