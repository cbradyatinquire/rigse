        - if home_page_preview_content.blank?
          - render_project_info
          = content_for :project_info
        -else
          = home_page_preview_content.html_safe
      - else
        - unless current_settings.home_page_content.blank?
          - home_page_content = current_settings.home_page_content
          = home_page_content.html_safe
        - else
          - render_project_info
          = content_for :project_info
    .signup-box
      = render partial: "home/signup"
