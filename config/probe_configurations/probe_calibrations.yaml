  description: "The Analog Devices TMP36 IC temperature sensor supplied in the ITSi Probekit has a nominal sensitivity of 10mV/\xC2\xB0C and an offset of 500 mV at 0 \xC2\xB0C. So the calibration function for a raw voltage input is: T = -50 + 100V, where T is temperature in Celsius and V is the voltage the sensor produces.\r\n"

  description: |
    The thermocouple wires supplied in the ITSI Probekit are iron and constantin. Two junctions are made so that a voltage will be produced that is proportional to the *difference* in temperature between the two junctions. The circuit uses the I-Amp with an amplification of 1000, giving 52 mV per degree of temperature difference.

    This calibration is for a wheel attached to the motor shaft with a radius of 3 cm. The circumference is 18.85 cm, so that linear velocity calibration is V = -(2.66/.17)*.1885 + (1/.17)*.1885 V, where V (m/s) is the velocity of the wheel rolling along a surface.\r\n\
